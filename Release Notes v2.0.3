Release 2.0.3

- This is the 8th release of ios_xr_mw_gatherer.py and ios_xr_mw_comparer.py.
- Combined these two scripts achieve the overall goal of having an output file from before and after a MW (or any type of event) detailing the state of the router for multiple routing protocols as well as the state of the OS. The second task ios_xr_mw_comparer achieves the goal of parsing these outputs and determining what information is relevant and has changed.
- The main problems these scripts attack is not knowing what commands to capture pre and post MW, and having to sort through lots of irrelevant data when doing a diff (like timestamps, uptime, etc).

New Commands Added:
- none

New Platforms Added:
- none

Enhancements:
- Minor regex and parsing issues in 3 comparer commands
